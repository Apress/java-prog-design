Banking Demo, Version 2

This version refactors version 1 into three classes:

The class Bank is responsible for the banking information.

The class BankClient is responsible for I/O processing.

The class BankProgram is responsible for putting everything together.
Here it doesn't do much, but it will in later versions.
