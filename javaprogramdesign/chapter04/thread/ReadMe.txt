Chapter 4 Thread Example

This code revises the chapter 3 thread example to use
the strategy pattern. That is, it implements ReadLine as a Runnable
instead of as a subclass of Thread.

One of the points of the example is that the two examples 
have very similar code even though they use very different
implementation techniques.
