Source Code for the book
Java Program Design: Principles, Polymorphism, and Patterns
by Edward Sciore

The folder "javaprogramdesign" contains a subfolder for each chapter. 
The source code for each chapter is organized by topic, 
with one folder per topic. Each topic folder has a file named ReadMe.txt that 
explains its Java code and its purpose.

The package of each Java file corresponds to its location in the folder hierarchy.
It should therefore be possible to run the code by simply downloading the folder
"javaprogramdesign" to your Java source code directory.
